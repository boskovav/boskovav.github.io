Phylogenetic tools applied to sequence data reconstruct a phylogenetic tree, a network structure that displays how the individuals in the population are related to each other. Phylodynamic tools take the inference a step further, by providing an estimate of the dynamics of the population that these individuals came from. When set in a Bayesian statistics framework, inferences of the phylogeny and the population dynamics are done simultaneously, rather than in a step-wise manner as in the maximum likelihood approach. This allows for possible uncertainty in the inference of the phylogeny to be integrated over when inferring the population dynamic parameters, but it also poses higher computational burden.

**Method development**  
Bayesian phylodynamics is a very powerful tool when inferring important epidemiological parameters, such as the start or the speed of spread of an epidemic in the population, or who infected whom in the transmission chain. However, its use for large datasets is still limited due to the computational effort required to process more than a few hundred sequences.
I develop fast methods to advance the use of Bayesian phylodynamics for deep sequencing data. 

**Understanding models**  
Crucial for correct application of any model is the awareness of its drawbacks and strengths. I therefore research at what conditions do the phylodynamic methods fail and thereby provide incorrect parameter estimates. Understanding of why exactly do the existing models break provides fruitful grounds for ideas on further methods development.

**Applications**  
I am interested in learing how the infections spread and how we can prevent epidemics. I therefore apply the phylodynamic models to real data to learn how quickly the infection spreads in the population and when it originated.
